<h1>ABC Insurance: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering</h1> 

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Customers are different. Their preferences, buying power, and other characteristics can differ over a wide spectrum (Onnen, Heiko. 2021). While mass marketing tactics are still able to get results, the assumption that simply everyone will be interested in buying what a company is selling is a time-consuming, inefficient, and expensive strategy (Upland Software). Common characteristics in customer segments can guide how a company markets to individual segments and what products it promotes to them, tailoring the marketing efforts to various audiencesâ€™ subsets. This process is called Customer Segmentation.</p>

<p>This project is concerned with identifying different customer profiles for the Marketing Department of an insurance company called ABC Insurance Limited, using the data mining clustering algorithm K-means in Python following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model. Before the k-means algorithm could be applied, an exploratory data analysis was carried out, followed by the data preparation, data reduction using Principal Component Analysis, data normalization, and finally, the modelling process itself.</p>

<p>As a result, five customer segments were identified in this analysis: Seniors, Blue-Collars, Gold Motor, Well-Educated in Region 4, and Diamond; where each one have very unique characteristics that can be used by ABC Insurance Limited to create a more data-driven marketing approach, that can result in the retention rate of customers with high monetary value by 10% and increase the acquisition of customers by at least 15% in the next two quarters.</p>
